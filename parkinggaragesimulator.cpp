/*Garage project (project 3) for CS 501. This simulates a parking service in multiple garages. From the project description: 
"When a car arrives it tries to park in the LOWER WEST. If no room it goes to the UPPER WEST...If still no room it waits in EAST.
When a car departs a message should indicate where it departed from (i.e. which garage). If there is a car waiting to get in the 
garage (because both are full) then the first car in the EAST must be moved into the garage that now has room and a message stating  
this must appear. When a car exits either WEST garage (but NOT EAST) the parking fee must be also be displayed as follows :
If the car is at the front of the queue, fee is $0, if second in the queue $10, if third or further back, $25. When we exit 
the program it should indicate how many cars are in each garage and the total of the fees collected." */
